\chapter{Data Analysis and Modeling}

In this section I will be using the \textit{Cosmicflows-3} (CF3) distance and redshift values to put our theory into effect! Below is a running list on how we will do this based on the theory in Chapter 3:

\begin{itemize}

\item We will calculate the peculiar velocity field

\item Perform a Fourier transform on our data

\item Measure the velocity and density power spectrum

\item Calculate the velocity covariance matrix (i.e. the correlations)

\item We will determine various maximum likelihood parameters based on the inclusion of the velocity correlations.
\end{itemize}
