# Results and Discussion

- In this section we present the results of our power scaling method using the Cosmicflows-3 catalogue. We then compare our results to $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ predictions by comparing the power scaled likelihood peaks to the likelihood of the standard model given the velocity data and then by comparing the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ from a marginalized likelihood analysis with and without power scaling the linear power spectrum $P(k)$.
