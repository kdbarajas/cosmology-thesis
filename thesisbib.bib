This is followed by a likelihood analysis where the maximum likelihood values for the moments and the small-scale noise are assessed. This allowed them to set cosmological constraints on the velocity power spectrum that reduces the influence of small-scale flows. This method showed that the difference velocity surveys were consistent in showing the same large-scale motion."

In this paper, they compare the results of various peculiar velocity surveys using both the full catalogue directly and the minimum variance weights method. They find that minimum variance weights method achieves its desired result too well in that it preferentially weights large-scale motion by filtering at a significant amount of small-scale information. While at small-scales the catalogue method is in strong agreement with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model, the minimum variance moments underestimates the power at this scale. What this underestimate means for the large-scale motion is that the small-scale motion that is filtered out by the moments method actually provides the necessary constraints that allow the bulk flow to agree with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Thus, they find that ultimately including more data from the velocity fields (i.e. the small-scale effects) improves the agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model."

The majority of papers on the bulk flow revolve around the data in this compendium as the Cosmicflows-3 was only released recently. The most critical issue with the Cosmicflows-2 is the lack of resolution at larger scales with an error of $\delta l = 0.20 H_0 r$. This meant that at large scales measurement errors dominated the distance values of individual galaxies and thus the only meaningful information that could be interpolated was from averaged values. This posed a serious issue with probing the large-scale motion, but the current Cosmicflows-3 compendium has improved upon these results.

	abstract ={We consider some aspects of the perturbation to the luminosity distance d(z) that are of relevance for SN1a cosmology and for future peculiar velocity surveys at non-negligible redshifts. (1) Previous work has shown that the correction to the lowest order perturbation ?d/d = ??v/cz has the peculiar characteristic that it appears to depend on the absolute state of motion of sources, rather than on their motion relative to that of the observer. The resolution of this apparent violation of the equivalence principle is that it is necessary to allow for evolution of the velocities with time, and also, when considering perturbations on the scale of the observer?source separation, to include the gravitational redshift effect. We provide an expression for ?d/d that provides a physically consistent way to measure peculiar velocities and determine their impact for SN1a cosmology. (2) We then calculate the perturbation to the redshift as a function of source flux density, which has been proposed as an alternative probe of large-scale motions. We show how the inclusion of surface brightness modulation modifies the relation between ?z(m) and the peculiar velocity, and that, while the noise properties of this method might appear promising, the velocity signal is swamped by the effect of galaxy clustering for most scales of interest. (3) We show how, in linear theory, peculiar velocity measurements are biased downwards by the effect of smaller scale motions or by measurement errors (such as in photometric redshifts). Our results nicely explain the effects seen in simulations by Koda et al. We critically examine the prospects for extending peculiar velocity studies to larger scales with near-term future surveys.},

While it has many objects in common with the COMPOSITE catalogue, a previously analysed collection of peculiar velocity data found to give an unexpectedly large bulk flow on large scales, the data in Cosmicflows-2 have been reanalysed to ensure consistency between distances measured using different methods. In particular, a focus on accurate distances led the authors of the Cosmicflows-2 to not correct for homogeneous or inhomogeneous Malmquist bias, both or which are corrected for in the COMPOSITE compilation. We find remarkable agreement between the COMPOSITE and the Cosmicflows-2 if the small EFAR sample of clusters located in two dense superclusters is removed from both surveys, giving results that are inconsistent with the ? cold dark matter standard model with Planck central parameters at the 98?per?cent level. On smaller scales we find overall agreement between data sets and consistency with the standard model.},

		abstract={We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new data set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis procedures to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This "Union" compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ). A single, consistent, and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain from supernovae on the dark energy density is ? ? = 0.713 + 0.027 ?0.029 (stat) + 0.036 ?0.039 (sys) , for a flat, ?CDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state parameter, w , the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give w = ? 0.969 + 0.059 ?0.063 (stat) + 0.063 ?0.066 (sys) . While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at z > 1. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.}

These objects, which include 13 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia at z ? 1, were discovered during 14 epochs of reimaging of the GOODS fields North and South over 2 yr with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on HST . Together with a recalibration of our previous HST -discovered SNe Ia, the full sample of 23 SNe Ia at z ? 1 provides the highest redshift sample known. Combining these data with previous SN Ia data sets, we measured H ( z ) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of H ( z > 1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk?the transition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The unique leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z ? 1. The result remains consistent with a cosmological constant [ w ( z ) = ?1] and rules out rapidly evolving dark energy ( dw / dz ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 1). The defining property of dark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z > 1, in the epoch preceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our primary fit. Moreover, the z > 1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of the typical SN Ia over the last 10 Gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution of the properties of SNe Ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.}

The supernovae were discovered as part of the ESSENCE project, and the light curves are a combination of Cerro Tololo 4 m and Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) photometry. On the basis of spectra and/or light-curve fitting, eight of these objects are definitely Type Ia supernovae, while the classification of one is problematic. The ESSENCE project is a 5 yr endeavor to discover about 200 high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, with the goal of tightly constraining the time average of the equation-of-state parameter [ w = p /(? c 2 )] of the "dark energy." To help minimize our systematic errors, all of our ground-based photometry is obtained with the same telescope and instrument. In 2003 the highest redshift subset of ESSENCE supernovae was selected for detailed study with HST . Here we present the first photometric results of the survey. We find that all but one of the ESSENCE supernovae have slowly declining light curves and that the sample is not representative of the low-redshift set of ESSENCE Type Ia supernovae. This is unlikely to be a sign of evolution in the population. We attribute the decline-rate distribution of HST events to a selection bias at the high-redshift edge of our sample and find that such a bias will infect other magnitude-limited Type Ia supernova searches unless appropriate precautions are taken.}

		abstract={We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe�Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe�Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ?300 SNe�Ia at z�<�0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST -based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST /FGS, HST /WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos , and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25���2.51, 72.04���2.67, 76.18���2.37, and 74.50���3.27 km s ?1 Mpc ?1 , respectively. Our best estimate of H 0�=�73.24���1.74 km s ?1 Mpc ?1 combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4 ? higher than 66.93���0.62 km s ?1 Mpc ?1 predicted by ?CDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06�eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1 ? relative to the prediction of 69.3���0.7 km s ?1 Mpc ?1 based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP +ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H 0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of ? N eff�?�0.4?1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H 0 from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.}

		abstract = {We introduce a new estimator of the peculiar velocity of a galaxy or group of galaxies from redshift and distance estimates. This estimator results in peculiar velocity estimates which are statistically unbiased and have Gaussian distributed errors, thus complying with the assumptions of analyses that rely on individual peculiar velocities. We apply this estimator to the SFI++ and the Cosmicflows-2 catalogues of galaxy distances and, since peculiar velocity estimates of distant galaxies are error dominated, examine their error distributions. The adoption of the new estimator significantly improves the accuracy and validity of studies of the large-scale peculiar velocity field that assume Gaussian distributed velocity errors and eliminates potential systematic biases, thus helping to bring peculiar velocity analysis into the era of precision cosmology. In addition, our method of examining the distribution of velocity errors should provide a useful check of the statistics of large peculiar velocity catalogues, particularly those that are compiled out of data from multiple sources. },
