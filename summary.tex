\chapter{Summary}
	While the normalize amplitude ratio agreed with the relationship we predicted, the measured phases for the combination modes disagreed with the predicted phases in the model. Therefore, instead we explored the phase difference between the measured phase and the predicted phase ($\Delta \phi = \phi_{\text{measured}} - \phi_{\text{predicted}}$) to determine the phase shift within our model. While the phase shift could be explained by the internal forces within the star that we did not take into account, we found an unexpected frequency dependence in the phase difference. This indicates that there may be an identifiable behavior within these multimode pulsators that we can incorporate into our model. The next step is to develop a theory to help us understand what is causing this relationship and hopefully further our understanding of these fascinating stars.
