\chapter{Results}
In our results section we will determine which cosmological model best matches the velocity correlations present in the CF3 catalog using the velocity covariance matrix.  

In our discussion/conclusion sections we will identify if disagreement is still found between our findings and the CMB data. If disagreement does exist and a plausible explanation for this disagreement can't be produced, then this would suggest a need to re-evaluate the current standard model. Personally, I hope that we find that our new method is consistent with the standard model as this would provide a valuable tool in understanding large scale motion. However, regardless of the results, we will either find a more suitable method for measuring the bulk flow or another method that despite taking small-scale influences into account still doesn't align with the standard model.
