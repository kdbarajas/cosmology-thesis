# Background: Standard Model of Cosmology 

- What is general relativity

- Using spacetime coordinates $(ct, x, y, z)$ to describe events.

  - where we define separation between two events by the line segment $ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \equiv \eta_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dy^\nu​$, an invariant quantity under coordinate transformation\footnote{This means that from any inertial frame of reference, an observer would measure the same separation $ds​$.}

  ​

$$
v_p \equiv \textbf{\textit{v}} \cdot \textbf{\hat{r}} = c \left ( \frac{z\text{obs} - z\text{cos}}{1 + z_\text{cos}}  \right)
$$

- $$
  1 + z = (1 + z_H)(1 + v_{pec}/c)
  $$
